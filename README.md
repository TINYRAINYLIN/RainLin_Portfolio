## Project Overview

### Hybrid Ensemble Recommender System | End to End Machine Learning Project
Links: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/The-Zero-Shot-Duo/Hybrid-Ensemble-Recommender-System) Â· [Live Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ZPENG127/Hybrid-Ensemble-Recommender-System)

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Surprise (SVD), PyTorch (NCF), XGBoost, Hugging Face, NLTK/VADER, Streamlit.
- Designed a multi-stage pipeline combining SVD/NCF collaborative filtering, BERT content similarity, and VADER sentiment to generate candidate items and features.
- Trained an XGBoost ranker to score candidates, reaching Precision@5 = 0.88, Recall@5 = 0.86, AUC = 0.89 on the Amazon Electronics dataset.
- Implemented Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) in PyTorch to add a deep-learning perspective to collaborative signals.
- Deployed a Streamlit app on Hugging Face Spaces for real-time exploration and evaluation.

#### **Status: Adding product catalog metadata enrichment (titles, images, categories) and UI search/filters so users see product names/thumbnails instead of raw IDs and can browse by keyword or category.**

### Zillow Home Value Prediction | End to End Machine Learning Regression Project
Links: [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/TINYRAINYLIN/Zillow_Property_Price_Prediction)

Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, RandomizedSearchCV/GridSearchCV, Ridge, Random Forest, LightGBM, Matplotlib/Seaborn.
- Built a property-value prediction pipeline on Zillow data: EDA, outlier/missing-value handling, and feature engineering.
- Trained and compared Ridge, Random Forest, and LightGBM with cross-validation, randomized hyperparameter search, and grid search.
- Added clear plots (RÂ²/MAE/RMSE) and residual diagnostics to validate stability.
- Random Forest delivered the top cross-validated performance (RÂ²â‰ˆ0.979, MAEâ‰ˆ5,266, RMSEâ‰ˆ87,717)

#### Status
- Current: Hyper-tuning RF & LGBM and selecting a champion model via CV + test metrics
- Next: Add explainability: feature importance â†’ permutation â†’ SHAP. Modularize into src/ + add predict.py and basic tests. Deploy Streamlit app.
