## Project

### Hybrid Ensemble Recommender System | End to End Machine Learning Project
- Built an end-to-end hybrid recommender on the Amazon Electronics dataset, combining collaborative filtering (SVD, NCF), content-based methods (BERT embeddings), and sentiment analysis (VADER).
- Enhanced recommendation accuracy with an XGBoost ranking layer, achieving Precision@5 = 0.88, Recall@5 = 0.86, AUC = 0.89.
- Deployed an interactive Streamlit app on Hugging Face Spaces, enabling real-time recommendations with MLOps lifecycle management.
- Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Surprise, XGBoost, PyTorch, Hugging Face, NLTK, VADER, Streamlit
